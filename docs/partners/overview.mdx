# Partner Integration Overview

Partners can embed the Widgetic canvas as a white-label solution, allowing their end-users to create and manage widgets directly within their platform.

## Partner API Key

Partners use API keys with the `wgt_prt_` prefix. These keys have access to:

- All user-level endpoints
- Partner-specific endpoints (managed users, UI components, partner billing)
- The ability to act on behalf of managed users

```

## Key Concepts

### Managed Users

Managed users are end-users of your platform. You create and manage them via the API, and they can use Widgetic features through your integration.

```typescript
import { ManagedUsersApi } from '@widgetic/api-sdk';

const managedUsers = new ManagedUsersApi('wgt_prt_your_partner_key');

// Create a managed user
const user = await managedUsers.createManagedUser({
  external_id: 'your-platform-user-123',
  metadata: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  }
});
```

### UI Components

Partners can embed pre-built UI components:

- **Widget Creator**: Full widget creation experience
- **Composition Editor**: Edit widget layouts and configurations  
- **Embed Editor**: Configure widget embed settings

### Credits System

Partners purchase operational credits that are consumed when their users use Widgetic features:

- AI-powered widget generation
- Storage usage
- API calls (above free tier)
