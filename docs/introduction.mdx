## Key Concepts

### Widgets
Widgets are reusable, configurable UI components built with Svelte. They can display data, collect input, or provide interactive experiences.

### Compositions
Compositions combine multiple widgets into a single layout, allowing you to create rich, multi-widget experiences.

### Canvases
Canvases are the editing environment where widgets are designed and configured. Partners can embed the canvas in their platforms.

### Components
Components are the building blocks within a canvas - individual elements that make up a widget's structure.

## API Key Types

Widgetic uses different API key prefixes to determine access levels:

| Key Prefix | Role | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `wgt_usr_` | User | Standard user access to manage own resources |
| `wdg_org_` | Organization | Organization-level access |
| `wgt_prt_` | Partner | Partner access for white-label integrations |
| `wgt_adm_` | Admin | Administrative access (internal) |

<Note>
  All public API endpoints are documented in the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction). The access level (`x-access-level`) determines which key types can call each endpoint.
