# Rate Limits

Rate limits protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage across all users. This page explains how rate limits work and how to handle them.

## How Rate Limits Work

Each API key has a rate limit based on your plan. Limits are applied per-minute with a daily cap.

| Plan | Per Minute | Per Day |
|------|------------|---------|
| Free | 60 | 1,000 |
| Pro | 300 | 10,000 |
| Partner | 600 | 50,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

## Reading Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes rate limit headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 300
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 295
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1705317600
```

Use these to track your usage and implement proactive throttling.

## Handling 429 Responses

When rate limited, you'll receive:

```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 60
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 60 seconds."
  }
}
```

### Implementation Example

```typescript
async function makeApiCall(fn, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.status === 429) {
        const retryAfter = parseInt(
          error.headers?.get('Retry-After') || '60'
        );
        console.log(`Rate limited. Waiting ${retryAfter}s...`);
        await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, retryAfter * 1000));
        continue;
      }
      throw error;
    }
  }
  throw new Error('Max retries exceeded');
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor headers proactively** - Slow down before hitting limits
2. **Implement exponential backoff** - Don't retry immediately
3. **Use batch endpoints** - Reduce total request count
4. **Cache responses** - Avoid redundant requests
5. **Spread requests** - Don't burst all at once
