description: Error codes and handling in the Widgetic API
---

The Widgetic API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns detailed error information in the response body.

## Error Response Format

All errors follow a standardized envelope format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED",
    "message": "The authentication token has expired",
    "correlationId": "req_123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "docUrl": "https://docs.widgetic.com/docs/authentication/tokens",
    "suggestedAction": "Refresh your authentication token"
  }
}
```

| `correlationId` | Unique request ID for support |
| `timestamp` | Error timestamp (ISO 8601) |

## Handling Errors

### JavaScript/TypeScript

```javascript
import { WidgetsApi } from '@widgetic/api-sdk';

const widgets = new WidgetsApi('YOUR_API_KEY');

try {
  const widget = await widgets.getWidgetById({ widgetId: 'invalid-id' });
} catch (error) {
  const { code, message, correlationId, suggestedAction } = error.body?.error || {};
  
  switch (error.status) {
    case 401:
      console.log('Authentication failed:', message);
      break;
    case 403:
      console.log('Access denied:', suggestedAction);
      break;
    case 404:
      console.log('Resource not found');
      break;
    case 429:
      const retryAfter = error.headers?.get('Retry-After') || 60;
      console.log(`Rate limited. Retry after ${retryAfter} seconds`);
      break;
    default:
      console.error('Error:', code, message);
      console.error('Correlation ID:', correlationId);
  }
}
```

### Correlation ID

Every error response includes a `correlationId`. Include this when contacting support:

```javascript
catch (error) {
  const correlationId = error.body?.error?.correlationId;
  console.error('Error correlationId:', correlationId);
  // Report to support with correlationId for faster resolution
}
```

## Retry Strategies

### Automatic Retry with Exponential Backoff

For transient errors (429, 503), implement exponential backoff:

```javascript
async function withRetry(fn, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (error) {
      const isRetryable = [429, 503, 504].includes(error.status);
      
      if (isRetryable && attempt < maxRetries - 1) {
        const retryAfter = error.headers?.get('Retry-After');
        const delay = retryAfter 
          ? parseInt(retryAfter) * 1000 
          : Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000; // 1s, 2s, 4s
        
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
        continue;
      }
      throw error;
    }
  }
}

const widget = await withRetry(() => 
  widgets.getWidgetById({ widgetId: 'widget-id' })
);
```

### Idempotent Retries

For POST/PUT operations, use idempotency keys to safely retry:

```javascript
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

const idempotencyKey = uuidv4();

const widget = await withRetry(() => 
  widgets.createWidget({
    createWidgetRequest: { name: 'My Widget' }
  }, {
    headers: { 'Idempotency-Key': idempotencyKey }
  })
);
```

## Rate Limit Headers

When rate limited, the response includes helpful headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed per window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the limit resets |
| `Retry-After` | Seconds to wait before retrying |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always Handle Errors">
    Never assume API calls will succeed. Always wrap calls in try/catch.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Log Correlation IDs">
    Store correlation IDs in your logs for debugging and support requests.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Implement Backoff">
    For rate limiting (429), use exponential backoff with jitter.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Idempotency Keys">
    For mutating operations, always include an idempotency key to safely retry.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Check Suggested Actions">
    Error responses include `suggestedAction` with guidance on how to resolve.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Validate Before Sending">
    Validate data client-side before making API calls to catch errors early.
  </Accordion>
